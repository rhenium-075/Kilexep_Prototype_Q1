Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

My signup requires additional inputs, is that supported?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, though an important thing to keep in mind is that there is no one-to-one
mapping of headed forms to headless input payloads. For example, while having to
enter your password twice makes sense in a headed environment, it is pointless
from an API point of view.  As a result, the headed forms that can be overridden
by means of ``ACCOUNT_FORMS`` play no role in the headless environment.

Instead of overriding the complete signup form via ``ACCOUNT_FORMS``, provide a
``ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FORM_CLASS`` as documented :doc:`here
<../account/configuration>` , listing the additional fields you need. These
fields will automatically show up in the headed signup form, and will
automatically be validated when posting payloads to the signup endpoint.
